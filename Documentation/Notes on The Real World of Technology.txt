Reciprocity

0:45 The problems that we need to address are not the sort of
  .. thing that one person can even begin to produce a solution.
  .. All i can do is an exercise of mapping, clarification, helping
  .. from wich a more collective approach will come
  .. A way through the dilemas of the time, that certainly is not a simple or transparent time.

     Focus on the human consquents of the communications technology

1:45 "Communications Technology" ~= Non communication technology
     when machines are introduced...
2:15 modes of interaction change
2:20 In general, technical arrangements reduce or eliminate reciprocity.
2:40 genuine interaction, carried out wiht a certain amount of reciprocity
3:05 when machines are introduced
 ... physical distance
 ... reciprocity is distored, can be reduced, can be eliminated


04:12 reciprocity ruled out by design
      loss of reciprocity is continueing form of technological inquality
   .. profound physicalogcal and policatl consequences.

04:40 reciprocity is not feedback
04:53 feedback is a particular technique of systems adjustment
   .. designed to improve specific performanes
   .. purpose of feedback is to make the thing work
      can improve the performance, but cannot alter the deisgn

reciprocity is situational - response to a given situation
   not designed
   can lead to unforseen outcomes – negotiations,
   technology can rule out reciprocity, rule out undesigned outcomes

intervention in violence

07:15 reciprocity is an important social parameter
07:40 where there is no reciprocity there is no need for listening
      then no need to understand or accomodate
      human isolation in automated offices
      tools or co-operation: listening, adjusting, accomodating, compromising, all these capabilies atrophy

08:25 prescriptive technologies are a seedbank for culture of compliance
      workplace

09:30 impact of tech on governeance, power and control
10:45 counterproductive patterns
11:00 need to know origin or current patterns

12:15 democratic decision making on technicalities and technical matters.
12:45 technological determinence, loss of autonomy
13:15 grafted, enforce
13:45 nature of systems
13:50 not thinking in the abstract
      web of interactions to see how tension of individual threads affect patterns and designs.
      one can change patterns, but only at certain places and ways
14:55 re-weaving
15:12 patterns of technology are not fixed
15:25 what are the structures? what are the rules?
15:45 prescriptive tech requires planning
      structuring authority ... enhance existing powers
      prescriptive tech is a good device for the structuring authority
17:30 discipline

19:30 prescriptions of dominance

25:00 observations on historical resistance to machines
threat to workers control and autonomy
25:45 luddites

35:15 electricity can’t be stored
industry, appliances demand electricity
35:50 planning for the electric grid was essential for industry
      spun as public responsibility, obscure advantage to industry

the industrial revolution = technology + the state

48:45 speeding, traffic safety
