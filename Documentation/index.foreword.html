      # Facts is:
      - a way of storing facts/datoms, that supports an accurate perception of what is known now, and what was known in the past.
      - a way of memorizing facts in a ECMAScript software program.
      - supports exploratory information programs.
      - playful because it can animate itself forward and backward through time.
      - a way of "managing" state in an ECMAScript computer program.
      - a programming for building outformations.
      - a database abstraction? (uncertain)
